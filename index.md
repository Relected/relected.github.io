## Welcome to GitHub Pages
This is my persional site for random stupid shit.

## 29/01/22; First blog:

Hi, i am relected, a random guy who likes computers and tinkering with stuff, i was into computers since i was 6 ears old (as long as i could remember)
i was fascinated about what computers can archive after i played my first few video game such as *IGI* and *GTA:VC*, some of yall might have heard of them as your childhood games.

i have been using linux for over two years now, starting with Ubuntu and ending up with void today, and god knows if i will distrohop from this distro to another (highlly unlikely since i have been using this distro for 9 months now)

i just started learning git to backup my dotfiles and GNU stow for managing them.
